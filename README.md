Inter-VLAN Routing Configuration Guide

Introduction
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for configuring inter-VLAN routing on a network device. Inter-VLAN routing allows communication between different VLANs within a network.

Prerequisites
Before proceeding with the configuration, ensure you have the following:

Access to the network device's management interface.
Administrative access privileges.
Basic understanding of VLANs and IP addressing.


Configuration Steps


Access the Device: Ensure you have access to the network device through a console connection or SSH.


Enter Configuration Mode:

Enter privileged EXEC mode:

enable



Enter global configuration mode:

configure terminal






Create VLANs (if not already created):
If VLANs haven't been created yet, use the following commands for each VLAN:


vlan <vlan_id>
name <vlan_name>
vbnet


Assign IP Addresses to VLAN Interfaces:
For each VLAN, assign an IP address to its respective VLAN interface:

interface vlan <vlan_id>
ip address <ip_address> <subnet_mask>
markdown


Enable Inter-VLAN Routing:
Enable routing on the device:

ip routing
markdown


Configure Inter-VLAN Routing:
Create VLAN interfaces and assign them to their respective VLANs:

interface vlan <vlan_id>
ip address <ip_address> <subnet_mask>
markdown


Verify Configuration:
Verify the configuration using the following commands:

show vlan brief
show ip interface brief
markdown
Ensure that VLANs and their IP addresses are correctly configured.


Save Configuration:
Save the configuration to ensure changes persist after a reboot:

end
copy running-config startup-config
csharp

Conclusion
Inter-VLAN routing is now configured on the network device, allowing communication between different VLANs within the network.
